## lrc lyrics
"lrc lyrics" are based on subtitles (like in movies) but with song lyrics!
these types of lyrics are more accurate with line start timings, but they're not always synced to the song word-by-word.

for a better experience with these lyrics, you can make the lyrics' color white in-game to not be bothered by the off-sync words - sort of like Just Dance: Yo-Kai Watch! :)
